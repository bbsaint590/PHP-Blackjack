# PHP Blackjack

Welcome to the PHP Blackjack project! This project is a simple web application built using PHP where users can simulate a game of Blackjack.

## Description

The PHP Blackjack is a web application designed to simulate the classic card game Blackjack. The user can simulate a Blackjack game between two players. Both players initally are dealt two cards. If their total goes over 21, they will be declared bust. If they get a total of 21 they will hit Blackjack! When a player has a total of 14 or less, they will be dealt a third card.
